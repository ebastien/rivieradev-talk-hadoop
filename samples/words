The
Earth
Pulled
by
the
Moon
But
it
was
part
of
the
merit
of
Newton
s
mighty
theory
of
gravitation
that
it
furnished
an
explanation
even
of
this
age
old
mystery
We
can
see
in
broad
outlines
at
any
rate
that
the
theory
of
universal
attraction
can
be
applied
to
this
case
For
the
moon
Newton
taught
us
pulls
every
particle
of
matter
throughout
the
earth
If
we
imagine
that
part
of
the
earth
s
surface
which
comprises
the
Pacific
Ocean
for
instance
to
be
turned
towards
the
moon
we
see
that
the
moon
s
pull
acting
on
the
loose
and
mobile
water
would
tend
to
heap
it
up
into
a
sort
of
mound
The
whole
earth
is
pulled
by
the
moon
but
the
water
is
more
free
to
obey
this
pull
than
is
the
solid
earth
although
small
tides
are
also
caused
in
the
earth
s
solid
crust
It
can
be
shown
also
that
a
corresponding
hump
would
tend
to
be
produced
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
owing
in
this
case
to
the
tendency
of
the
water
being
more
loosely
connected
to
lag
behind
the
solid
earth
If
the
earth
s
surface
were
entirely
fluid
the
rotation
of
the
earth
would
give
the
impression
that
these
two
humps
were
continually
travelling
round
the
world
once
every
day
At
any
given
part
of
the
earth
s
surface
therefore
there
would
be
two
humps
daily
i
e
two
periods
of
high
water
Such
is
the
simplest
possible
outline
of
the
gravitational
theory
of
the
tides
